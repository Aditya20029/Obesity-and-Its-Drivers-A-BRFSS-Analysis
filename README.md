Obesity and Its Drivers: A BRFSS Data Analysis
This project analyzes the relationship between physical activity, dietary habits, socioeconomic factors, and obesity prevalence in the United States using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. Implemented a full data pipeline leveraging AWS (S3, Glue DataBrew, RDS) for scalable storage, cleaning, and profiling, combined with Python, R, and SQL for statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling. The study explores regional, urbanâ€“rural, and income-based disparities, builds predictive models, and provides insights to inform public health policies.

Key Features:

Data Cleaning & Storage: R-based preprocessing, AWS Glue DataBrew profiling, and Amazon RDS for structured SQL queries.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) and R (ggplot2) for univariate, multivariate, and correlation analysis.

Modeling: Regression, Random Forest, and ARIMA forecasting for obesity trends.

Visualization: Interactive dashboards and static plots highlighting disparities.

Public Health Insights: Identifies correlations between physical inactivity, poor diet, low income, and obesity rates.
